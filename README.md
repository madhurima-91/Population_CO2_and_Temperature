# CO2_Emission_and_Temperature

I created an infographic exploring if population explosion has led to temperature rise. The scripting involved data collection, cleaning and exploratory analysis. 
For this purpose, I used ggplot2 package in R  to create visualizations using data on country-wise population, energy consumption, fuel-wise energy production, carbon dioxide emission and global temperature change from 1965 to 2020. 
Using multiple plots, I show that population rise led to increased energy demand supplied via fossil fuel burning which in turn resulted in rapid carbon dioxide emission specifically in more populated world regions. 
This carbon increase has led to around 1 degree rise in global temperature.
Data has been taken from  Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions) and uploaded as separate CSV files. It was a self-paced project.
